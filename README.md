This repo contains the practice assignments completed during Leon Noel's [free 5 week front-end bootcamp](https://leonnoel.com/blog/free-coding-bootcamp/). Lessons are live streamed twice a week [on Leon's Twitch channel](twitch.tv/learnwithleon).

During this bootcamp myself and fellow campers are learning the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Leon rules. You can check out more about him [here](https://leonnoel.com).
