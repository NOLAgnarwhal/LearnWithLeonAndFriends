This repo contains the practice assignments completed during Leon Noel's <a href="https://leonnoel.com/blog/free-coding-bootcamp/">free 5 week front-end bootcamp</a>. Lessons are live streamed twice a week<a href="twitch.tv/learnwithleon"> on Leon's Twitch channel</a>.

During this bootcamp myself and fellow campers are learning the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
